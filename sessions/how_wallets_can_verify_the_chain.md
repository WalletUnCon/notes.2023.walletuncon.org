Tips:
- if you use github or gitlab handles instead of names, that allows scribes and conveners to be easily findable/taggable in threads when these notes get published to the CASA github org)
- preface remarks with name/handle and org if you WANT to be credited for contributions or ideas. 
- feel free to call multiple people "anon" if you don't catch their names or they do not give them
- most scribes love an assist!
