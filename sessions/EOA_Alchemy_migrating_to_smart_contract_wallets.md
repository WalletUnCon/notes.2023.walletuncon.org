Tips:
- if you use github or gitlab handles instead of names, that allows scribes and conveners to be easily findable/taggable in threads when these notes get published to the CASA github org)
- preface remarks with name/handle and org if you WANT to be credited for contributions or ideas. 
- feel free to call multiple people "anon" if you don't catch their names or they do not give them
- most scribes love an assist!

## Notes

- EIP 4337

- EIP 7377 or EIP 5003 - deploy code at your EOA
- EIP 3074 - slay
- EIP 7553 (number not assigned yet) - sponsored transactions


####  UX-level changes

- push to the libraries (ethers/viem) for batching user ops / fallback to eoas 
- 6963 : multi injected provider
