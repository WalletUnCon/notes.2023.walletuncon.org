# Notes for session H1 at WalletUncon 2023

Title of talk: Designing Iron Wallet - a Developer-centric Wallet Design
Convener(s) of talk: Filipa Ribeiro + Jos√© Resende

## Notes

- While developing smart contracts, all the steps from resetting a nonce to configuring transaction parameters every time you are testing your code, stack up quickly. All while needing access to debugging features that aren't meant for end users. In the end, it amounts to a lot of frustration and time.
- We talked about Iron Wallet and how it intends to improve the developer experience. 
- We also taked about pain points developers face while developing smart contracts and while interacting with dapps.
