## Notes

- What is opensource?
    - More than just view source
    - Specific defintion of 10 points, really focused on the universal freedom to audit, use, redistribute & modify 
    - Most things that are referred to as "opensource" do not meet this strict definition
    - Things that are *only* auditable are called **source available**
    - **copyleft:** Not technically open source but a great way to restrict opportunistic profit off a common resource for private profit
    - Which approach you want to use will depend on your intent and context. For example, if you are developing a library that is targeting software developers, you'll want the most permissive approach â€” in order to enable the broadest adoption.
    - Biggest problem in opensource is: *funding!* 
        - eg. Amazon hosting infra and support request being largely received by the unpaid opensource contributors.
        - Many of the licenses that deviate from pure opensource, in an attempt to solve the funding problem, still have big trouble with monitoring and enforcement.
    - Biggest benefits to opensource: *interdependence!*
        - the permissiveness of the license enables a broader community to rely upon the tool
        - the knock on effect is improvements in quality, reliability, security and transparency
        - can offer greater guarantees wrt the longevity of the project
    - Other problems are related to coordination
        - disagreement over the roadmap sometimes even to the point of death threats!
        - **opensource entitlement:** assumption that the maintainers work for the adopters. 
- What does a healthy opensource community look like?
    - in general, stewardship is very difficult and takes a lot of work
    - human decency
