### Initial requirements defined in discussion

# Wallet Working Group Charter

Now that Ethereum ERCs are separate from EIPs, we need to define a process. We will take inspiration from relevant processes, including EIP-1, but write something from scratch that is tailored to our specific needs.

## Goals / Requirements
- Record of decisions and archive
- "Principle of voluntarism"
  - Wallets/Snaps/Dapps can ultimately do whatever they want! This is a best-effort basis to coordinate between wallets.
- Minimum 2 implempentations to finalize - enshrine test suite as the way to determine this
- Method to signal objection and way to override objection in finalization
    - The ability to override finalization is done by an appointed group (similar to TAG at W3C)
- Need an Errata ability and/or the ability to make a standard living similar to WHATWG and version off a commit
- Proposals will be numbered following the EIP process
- Proposals will be expired if they are not finalized with a certain period of time
    - A year?
