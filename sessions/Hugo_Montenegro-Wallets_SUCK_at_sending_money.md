## Notes

- Questions: what is a crypto wallets?
- If you don't have internet then wallets
- Crypto users are a proper subset of tradfi users
- PayPal in the late 90s and early 00s had a very strong acquisition mechanism through viral onboarding
- There are over 100 VC funded wallet startups in crypto
- Some random comments about cats
- how to connect crypto and tradfi
    - zkp2p -> decentralised offramp
- Links are an alternative for dealing with the complexities. Examples: Peanut Protocol, Daimo.xyz, TipLink, Beam Wallet
    - These links use secret-protected vault smart contracts. The sender deposits tokens to the vault and sends the URL to the receiver. The URL contains a secret, allowing the receiver to withdraw the funds. 
- zkp2p from zkemail + link-based payment mechanism with instant offramping
- projects using links as a wa of transferring funds: request.finance, peanut.to, daimo.xyz, beam wallet.
